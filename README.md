**Fask** is the **f**amily t**ask** management system, the goal of the project is to implement a complex task management tool, which allows users to manage their daily and recurent tasks in their families.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is developed for [100 Commits](https://100commitow.pl/) competition.

Initially, I would like to focus on providing basic functionality which you have seen in other project management system like Azure DevOps or Jira.
