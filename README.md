**Fask** is the web **f**amily t**ask** management system. The goal of the project is to implement a complex web task management tool, which allows users to manage their daily and recurrent tasks in their families.  

> [!NOTE]
> This project is developed for [100 Commits](https://100commitow.pl/) competition.

## âœ¨ Features

For MVP, I want to provide basic functionality which you have seen in other project management system like Azure DevOps or Jira. 

### Registering users

New users can be registered directly in the application or using third party login as Facebook or Google.

### Creating families and assigning users to them

Each user can create a family (group of users) and assign other users to these families. A user can be assigned to many families.

### Creating detailed tasks list

A user can create tasks and place these task on the lists. Task can be different types and contains all details necessary to complete the task.

#### Task

> **TBD**
* different type of tasks (shopping list, to-do list, generic task, recurring task)
* what data should the task contain?
* assigning users to tasks.
* statuses.
* time.
* task lifetime.

### Creating family task board (kanban)

A user can create a kanban board within a family and can place task on that board to track status and progress on tasks.

### Creating private task board (per user)

A user can create a private kanban board and place there its private tasks.

### Viewing combined board of all families and private board

A user can view combined board of all their tasks.

### Notifications

> **TBD**

You can find detailed plan on the [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNl67_8U=/?share_link_id=909566077735).
