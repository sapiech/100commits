**Fask** is the **f**amily t**ask** management system which I want to develop for the [100 commitow](https://100commitow.pl/) competition. 

The goal of the project is to implement a complex family task management system, which allows users to manage their daily and recurent tasks in their families.  

Initially, I would like to focus on providing basic functionality which you have seen in other project management system like Azure DevOps or Jira. 

You can find detailed plan on the [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNl67_8U=/?share_link_id=909566077735).
